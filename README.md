## shortcoming

ProComponents is a UI component library based on React and designed for enterprise-level applications. Although ProComponents has many advantages, there are also some disadvantages to consider:

- Limited customization: ProComponents provides a rich set of components, but the customization options are relatively limited. It may be challenging to customize the components to meet specific project requirements.

- Steep learning curve: ProComponents has a complex API and documentation, which can be challenging for beginners to understand and use. The learning curve may be steep, and it may take some time to become proficient in using the library.

- Limited browser compatibility: ProComponents relies on modern browser features and may not work correctly on older browsers. This can limit the reach of the application and require additional development time to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

- Heavy codebase: ProComponents has a large codebase, which can slow down the development process and make it more challenging to maintain the codebase over time.

In summary, ProComponents is a powerful UI component library for enterprise applications, but it also has some limitations, such as limited customization, a steep learning curve, limited browser compatibility, and a heavy codebase. Developers should carefully evaluate their project requirements and constraints before choosing to use ProComponents.
