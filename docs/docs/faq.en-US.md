## FAQ

Here are some commonly asked questions from the ProComponents community along with official responses. Before asking a question, it is recommended to check if there are similar questions. Additionally, we maintain a [how to use tag](https://github.com/ant-design/pro-components/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%F0%9F%A4%B7%F0%9F%8F%BC+How+to+use%22+) , which has a higher number of feedback that you can refer to.

### Can the data format returned by ProTable requests be customized?

No, it is not possible. However, you can transform the data in the request or use an interceptor.

[Example](https://beta-pro.ant.design/docs/request-cn)

### How can I hide the label generated by ProTable search?

The title property in columns supports a function, so you can write it like this:

```typescript
title: (_, type) => {
  if (type === 'table') {
    return '标题';
  }
  return null;
};
```

### I'm unable to install `ProComponents` and its dependencies. By the way, I'm in the Mainland of China.

Well, you can try [cnpm](http://npm.taobao.org/) and [yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn).

### `Form` within `initialValues`

`ProComponents` is based on [antd](https://ant.design/index-cn), so the usage is similar to [antd](https://ant.design/index-cn). Note that `initialValues` cannot be dynamically updated using `setState`. You need to use `setFieldsValue` to update it. `initialValues` only takes effect once during `form` initialization. If you need to load asynchronously, it is recommended to use `request` or `initialValues ? <Form/> : null`.

### Compatibility issues with browsers below Chrome 88

Since `ProComponent` uses newer CSS properties, the desired compatibility may not be achieved in older browsers (even if your project has polyfills configured).

Therefore, additional compatibility configurations are required:

1. Configure according to this documentation: <https://ant.design/docs/react/compatible-style-cn>

2. If it's a Umi project, you can configure in app.ts ：

```typescript
import {
  StyleProvider,
  legacyLogicalPropertiesTransformer,
} from '@ant-design/cssinjs';

export function rootContainer(container: React.ReactElement) {
  return React.createElement(
    StyleProvider,
    {
      hashPriority: 'high',
      transformers: [legacyLogicalPropertiesTransformer],
    },
    container,
  );
}
```

## Errors and Warnings

Here are some errors and warnings you may encounter while using ProComponents. However, some of them may not be related to ProComponents bugs.

### Cannot read property 'Provider' of undefined

Please make sure your Ant Design version is >= `4.11.1`
