# StepsForm

StepsForm manages the data of sub forms through a Provider, each word form is a complete set of data that is combined in StepsForm to form the final data. It also comes with a progress bar and a related API to manage the progress bar.

> StepsForm inherits from Form.Provider, see the documentation [here](https://ant.design/components/form/#Form.Provider), the value of the transformed moment is a function provided by ProForm, so `onFormFinish` and `onFormChange` where the values are untransformed.

### StepForm

Exactly the same as [ProForm](/components/form), except that onFinish supports Promise, so if it returns `false`, it won't jump to the next step.

| Parameters | Description | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| onFinish | form submit success trigger | `(values:T)=>Promise<false>` | - |
