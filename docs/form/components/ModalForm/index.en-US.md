# Modal/DrawerForm - Floating Forms

ModalForm and DrawerForm are a variant of ProForm, which is still a form in essence. So you can't customize the footer with `footer`, if you want to define the footer you need to use `submitter.render` to customize it. These two forms behave like ProForm and can be modified directly from ProForm.

ModalForm and DrawerForm both provide triggers to reduce state usage, if you need to use state control you can use `open` and `onOpenChange` to control opening and closing.
